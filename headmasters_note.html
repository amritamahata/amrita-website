    <p align="center">Ghasiara Vidyapith that we see today, with its magnificent architecture, has a long amazing
        history.

        Officially, we count 2nd January 1962 as our foundation day, but the real effort was initialized much before. As
        per the sources, it was the year 1950-51, when some enlightened men felt the urge to build a school in the
        socially, economically and educationally backward area of ghasiara and its surroundings for the total betterment
        of the people. In one of the evening gatherings at Srikanta Mondal’s house, the decision of starting a pathsala
        (small school) was taken.

        In 1954-55 onwards the school got Government aids and also got the approval of a free –primary school. At that
        time, it was a four-roomed building school and a tube-well was also set up .

        Thereafter, under the able leadership of the respectable educationalist Haricharan Mondal, the dream run of
        Ghasiara Vidyapith started. Many people donated land, money and labor for the school. Some notable personalities
        are Satish Naskar, kokil Mondal, Ghanteshwar Mondal, Palan Mondal, Haran Naskar, Bankim Naskar, Badal Ganguly,
        Jotirmoy Ganguly and many others.

        In the meantime in 1962 the school got the approval of a junior high school with only class five (V) and later
        class six (VI) in 1963.

        The first Headmaster of the primary section was Sri Harandeb Mahashay and of the madhyamik section was Mr.
        Narayan Bhowmick Mahashay and later Haridhan Chakraborty Mahashay and then in 1965 Mr. Shasticharan Mondal
        became the headmaster. During his tenure, the school got the approval of a Madhyamik level school. In 1997 the
        school got the recognition of a H.S. level school with only Arts section. The then Headmaster was Mr. Sukumar
        Sen. In 2003 the school got the approval to introduce Science and Commerce sections. 2013 market the year of
        Golden Jubilee celebration of the school. In 2017 District YPC was held in the school.

        Today Ghasiara Vidyapith has achieved the glory of a renowned school. It has developed not only in the field of
        education but also in cultural and sports fields. Every year annual sports day is celebrated with much grandeur.
        Our students also achieve Star Marks and even above 90% marks in Madhyamik and H.S. We have expert and
        star-class faculty to lead our way for touching more milestones in the near future.</p>
